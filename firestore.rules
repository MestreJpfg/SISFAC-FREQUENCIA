/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the school attendance tracker.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements role-based access control (RBAC) to protect data.
 * All operations require an authenticated user whose profile is marked as active
 * in the 'users' collection. Specific roles (admin, superUser, user) dictate
 * permissions on the 'students' and 'attendance' collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores individual student data.
 * - /attendance/{attendanceId}: Stores individual attendance records.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles with role and status.

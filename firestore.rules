/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict read/write access model for student and attendance records.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores individual student records, secured behind owner-only access.
 * - /attendance/{attendanceId}: Stores individual attendance records, secured behind owner-only access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete student records. Anonymous auth is enabled in the app, so unauthenticated access is permitted in these rules.
 * - Listing of students and attendance records is disallowed to prevent unauthorized data scraping.
 * - All writes require the user to be authenticated (request.auth != null).
